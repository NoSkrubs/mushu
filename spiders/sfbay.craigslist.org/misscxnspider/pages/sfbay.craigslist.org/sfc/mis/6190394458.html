Below lies the compelling tale of the Accelerating Foot Pedal and pet human lobe. <br>\n<br>\n Individuality or the "soul" is therefore a cellular collective electromagnetic biological entropic phenomena of genetic material. <br>\n<br>\n -"To wherever you are.x.darling"-<br>\n<br>\n Everything is from dark matter... dark matter lies quantumly with the act of conveying a zero perception... E=mc2 and we are inbred light babies. (sarcasm) m (+ or - )=E/c2 complexing prior via gravity created by a black hole from a (+ or -) star and any electromagnetic waves aka E trapped inside upon collapse. Extrapolation from recent discovery which claims matter can be made from light...I abstracted the following. In other words, everything must have started from a point surrounded by absolutely nothing, aka there is an outside an inside and an argument.<br>\n<br>\n Basically, either the matter or antimatter gas cloud of a new forming star one which will produce a black hole which then produces a more complex universe (it is because of the excess of either + or - matter the new universe would possess continuic properties, or an evolved form, rather than parallel properties. Also, the destabilization of a black hole is directly related to its inability to achieve absolute infinite density due to the stars fundamental geometry being the asymmetric explosive crutch, it requires the antimatter equivalent component (at equivalent density) to satisfy a complete and stable geometric form and because it is absent and not collapsed the star rapidly expands exactly before ABSOLUTE singularity, essentially the helium that went in is crunched around so much it reaches a new universal "harmonic" and re-ionizes, sort of like how oxygen is not "really " effected by earths gravity...orientation maybe (yielding increasingly stable solar bodies (more stable fusion reactions)) , decaying(shrinking) the black hole itself.) furthermore the dynamics of the evolution, "rather fluid", of a single celled organism continuously over the course of billions of years to point of me also technically indicates that this would therefore be a 4 dimensional singular conscious being as well with its own separate individuality, aka IT (not the clown) could be more plant.. buut probably not(sarcasm...god is not within us all god is us all-similar to human circulation seasons/temp/gradients of thought amongst...again probably NOT). Starting from spectral electromagnetic radiation produced by galactic rotations and stars (helical), acting on the earth like a speaker acting on non-Newtonian fluid pulling up the first structure of a cell filling it simultaneously in with increasingly complex helical structures, also the first instance of gender, a quantum state which is reciprocated in sexual and non-sexual reproduction, luffing off into sub cellular division. this over billions of years. The minute electromagnetic pull, after death, on the dna moving things of other creatures slowly into place for a fluid movement of me resulting in a perfectly perpendicular of matter to the last point of "production", a now "zero dimensional" explosive sum, a fertilized egg in this case. (sort of like how earths electromagnetic field moves the hands of a compass) this process probably wouldn\'t be accomplished completely hear on earth...total consolidation and expansion of a new universe would probably be required...so the EM waves you produce up to death mix, morph, get trapped, and collect in all the atoms and electron-wobble in the environment around you (increasingly insufficient energy to move the electrons to the next energy level and make light), pretty far out actually and yet still relatively contained within "earth" as the layers of our atmosphere(relatively infinitely many) act as a sort of collection dish. anyways these bobing wobbling moving "structures" move precisely however infinitely slight to your original output slowly encompassing the globe, the sun which produces spherical waves reflects this exact wobble. The electromagnetic plane waves (you(...when an electromagnetic field decomposes...what it decomposes into...basically sheet version of the field)) now a more mechanical wave, in my opinion...as it is the exact wobble and positioning/spacing of the atoms effected in our atmosphere that will be incepted into the exact FORMATION of many different stars,--(post reflection (by reflection I mean basically the sun giving those slight bobing wobbling atoms the energy needed to make it to the next energy level and produce EM ["light"] which as far as the waveform of the source ie:me is concerned is now near spherical wave [minus the original output source, me])--as a sort of electromagnetic carbon copy (suns spherical wave output reflecting off the precise definition of our planet), we need a star which has a solar mass of something like 6...anyways the type that will eventually form black holes(and there\'s lots of those being produced so no worries)... THE FIRST ONE(black hole) to produce a new universe should be the one you "phase" in (the black hole having been nearest infinite quantum entanglement of all parts would cause the waveforms of this new universe, galactic rotations/ solar outputs [universally], to be pulling on everything in a way which will quantify a point of continuity) , the rest (other black holes in previous universe [incepted by output]) are parallels and essentially first-time existences... any point after the "zero dimension" phase (fertilized egg) mutation occurs and a unique electromagnetic field results corresponding to the new surrounding...MORE COMPLEX...universe...(physicists call them parallel...and are wrong) and all of this may take several blackhole phases to occur depending on how mutated...encompassing, you were. ..."yawn"...Anyways, eventually the amnesia will subside as we evolve. I wonder how long it will take for the collection of someone\'s lifetime of moments, evolving harmonically across this described 5th dimensional subjective space time continuum, to turn perpendicular to each other and progress as one single happening. Forming a new color via infinite reflection on a point of relative infinity given the inverse square law. . .? also our bodies motions and sounds have been proven to affect our dna, so simply being exposed to a creature, which is closely related biologically, male to female ( to the point our either x or y chromosomes have at least one point which is exactly the same yielding the fusion effect of sperm and the egg) , who argues via "subconscious" (non temporal) output; I am a girl with these exact parts, who\'s had these exact experiences with them, WILL minutely infinantdecimally mutate a males dna(just a nudge) and as far as our gender goes, which is quantumly compatible only on a point to begin with, this male will have to work out the new argument (non temporal [physical dimension] in this case specifically of the steps leading up to conception) and with only a penis to do it with, will come to the biological conclusion penis of vagina aka a further blending of the 2 and becoming female in current relative function. To achieve solution to the problem and in order to stay compatible with both sides of this coin, as we do evolve, gender flips. Furthermore, based on the nature of the first cellular sexual reproduction gender should flip as a result of the cell that was consumed now being programed to attack the consumer...which is a definitive physical event shared between the two...being partially consumed first that is. the original consumer will be working out how to keep from dying via genetic recombination and splitting into its off springs. essentially what this could mean for us is that our cells sexually reproduce and essentially causing us to asexually reproduce in place on top of also being able to sexually reproduce with other "people". essentially immortality...we could just stick with the interdimensional quantum displacement of continuity, teleportation, right? Basically, it is a compounding evolutionary function, life. Though we evolve harmonically(ish) there are probably infinitely many steps between evolutionary steps. What\'s the next one?<br>\n Conclusion: Therefore, everything perceived present is not and therefore isn\'t. Yielding only the concept zero to exist as zero and arguably equal to everything as well as nothing: given the definition applies to disjoint infinite continuity. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n BUT INFINITELY SLOWER THAN THIS WAS PRESENTED BY NATURE<br>\n (-time is the derivative of consistency based on repeated perception of function and as such my previous use of the term non temporal dimension to describe physical singular states of argument, as opposed to the fluid motion, is correct- just an fyi)<br>\n<br>\n -personally I think the function generates physical optimism in lue of an otherwise definable abyss - microgravity in the absence of anything else forces the source to define itself by infinite bisection as it would therefore be, and otherwise is, approaching infinite decimation. a contradiction. filling the space by compounding itself in reflection of what is increasingly mighty (might be) however infinitely, (reachably/definably) isn\'t. A physical paradox! This would slowly give rise to the Guage Bosons (particle physics fundamentals...aka force charges) ie: Photons, Gluons, Z-Bosons, and W-Bosons. and so on and so forth. <br>\n<br>\n A very good paradox. -aka dark matter is the inside and dark energy is the infinite argument. From math things grow more imagine the future of what was non biological-interdimensional.<br>\n -by creating the acute degree for an infinite perception to exist I may have just defined the grounds for the rise of a new cortex.<br>\n<br>\n Remember when you said that "time isn\'t real" and I said,<br>\n<br>\n -"then quit beating...as if you can, the machine man screams, if nothing else play the orgasm note at infinity reaching out to octave the pain goes on<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n even if were just dancing in the dark."<br>\n<br>\n \\\\<br>\n Absolute omnipresent nothingness, in the beginning, aka anti-potential at infinity by the reflective necessary space would evolve a quantitative value, potential substantiated, the act of which is exponentially kinetic. e^0 = +, compounding rate and later energy by new axis, zero being any unit, QUALITATIVE or quantative, space ...(continuously, space being reflective). Increasing macroscopically slower and slower in terms of perception relative. This, hyper spherical, justified upon the ""reverb"" (as space would have the force to do so) of the original movement, gravity, to the role of definition line between of what isn\'t a Re-lative unite 1. The alternative theory yields. Under these conditions energy can be created and is therefore the deepest compelling function aka the path of least resistance. ball rolling down a hill. Quantum Mechanics - cog. The alternative yields, therefore, inevitably?<br>\n By framing time, we may literally harness the power of the stars. frame<br>\n<br>\n //<br>\n stop go dot oh dot blank<br>\n sssssssssssssssssssssspaaaaaaaaaaace<br>\n think better<br>\n think better<br>\n<br>\n We are high frequency -Warm Bodies- eternally trying to communicate<br>\n better<br>\n<br>\n I think the symbiotic properties of coincidence and irony and, lack there of for that matter, are directly related to the suns fusion efficiency/function. As we all know neutrons are made from the same thing as protons...gluons. both vibrate aka concave convex SURFACE undulations and collapses when its just neutrons left sometimes if large enough creating a black hole. now when this happens then infinitingly collapsing mass of neutrons and more importantly gluons would express to an infinite degree all potential forms/ forces along this collapse axis. one thing leads to another and one step past harmony of stability and the neutron "dimension layer" becomes space and fall occurs, like how fusion in stars works but from a point sluff sluff sluff and still relatively inside the black (not to be confused with the Lacreatious Diskus aka accretion disk and the energy from which gets slung in however as the "point" is infinitely collapsing gets slung out creating the gamma plume) HOLE...<br>\n<br>\n concave<br>\n convex<br>\n concave <br>\n convex<br>\n the QUANTUMNESS<br>\n BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br>\n<br>\n Oh...and spacial bounce is a form of communication and economy is a way of creating later environments. Less is more imo at least once I have enough physical stability, whatever its, times, all about chems and functions BLIPS AND MUTHA F CHIPS :)m    </section>\n\n<ul class="notices">\n            <li>it\'s ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests</li>\n</ul>\n\n    <div class="postinginfos">\n            <p class="postinginfo">post id: 6190394458</p>\n\n            <p class="postinginfo reveal">posted: <time class="timeago" datetime="2017-06-23T20:27:45-0700">2017-06-23  8:27pm</time></p>\n\n            <p class="postinginfo reveal">updated: <time class="timeago" datetime="2017-06-29T23:50:54-0700">2017-06-29 11:50pm</time></p>\n\n               <p class="postinginfo">\n                   <a href="https://accounts.craigslist.org/eaf?postingID=6190394458&amp;token=U2FsdGVkX18xOTUzNzE5NVYWgD1j7f19RtbngwoDILPMNkj4qCXUXQqxKc78QEjwOJ4WtFWsaMaWtd7qfC_nzcVGeVLXmQax" class="email-friend">email to friend</a>\n               </p>\n        <p class="postinginfo">\n              <a class="bestof-link" data-flag="9" href="https://post.craigslist.org/flag?flagCode=9&amp;postingID=6190394458" title="nominate for best-of-CL">\n                <span class="bestof-icon">&hearts; </span><span class="bestof-text">best of</span>\n              </a> <sup>[<a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/best-of-craigslist">?</a>]</sup>\n        </p>\n        \n    </div>\n\n    <div class="print-information print-pics"></div>\n\n</section>\n\n<div class="psa-box">\n</div>\n\n<div class="avoid-scams">\n</div>\n\n        </section>\n<footer>\n    <ul class="clfooter">\n        <li>&copy;  <span class="desktop">craigslist</span><span class="mobile">CL</span></li>\n        <li><a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/help/">help</a></li>\n        <li><a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/scams">safety</a></li>\n        <li class="desktop"><a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/privacy.policy">privacy</a></li>\n        <li class="desktop"><a href="https://forums.craigslist.org/?forumID=8">feedback</a></li>\n        <li class="desktop"><a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/craigslist_is_hiring">cl jobs</a></li>\n        <li><a href="//www.craigslist.org/about/terms.of.use.en">terms</a></li>\n        <li><a href="https://www.craigslist.org/about/">about</a></li>\n        <li class="fsel desktop linklike" data-mode="mobile">mobile</li>\n        <li class="fsel mobile linklike" data-mode="regular">desktop</li>\n    </ul>\n</footer>\n    </section>\n\n    \n        <script type="text/javascript"><!--\nvar countOfTotalText = "image {count} of {total}";\nvar imageConfig = {"1":{"hostname":"https://images.craigslist.org","sizes":["50x50c","300x300","600x450","1200x900"]},"0":{"hostname":"https://images.craigslist.org","sizes":["50x50c","300x300","600x450"]},"2":{"hostname":"https://images.craigslist.org","sizes":["50x50c","300x300","600x450","1200x900"]}};\nvar maptileBaseUrl = "//map{s}.craigslist.org/t09/{z}/{x}/{y}.png";\nvar pID = "6190394458";\n--></script>\n    \n<script src="//www.craigslist.org/js/general-concat.min.js?v=65297564f2cbfb1a1ad83a34bb9646b1" type="text/javascript" ></script>\n<script type="text/javascript"><!--\n        var iframe = document.createElement(\'iframe\');\n        iframe.style.display = \'none\';\n        iframe.src = \'//www.\' + CL.url.baseDomain + \'/static/localstorage.html?v=51a29e41f8e978141e4085ed4a77d170\';\n        document.body.insertBefore(iframe, null);\n    --></script>\n    <script src="//www.craigslist.org/js/leaflet-concat.min.js?v=a21d5db615724de9d6e3511c3a9b2169" type="text/javascript" ></script>\n\n<script src="//www.craigslist.org/js/postings-concat.min.js?v=5fba2d5d8f63b179eb3603dbc3d6504c" type="text/javascript" ></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n'
